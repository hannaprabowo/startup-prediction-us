A data science project to predict the success of startups in the US. To build preidction, four models will be developed, from basic to a more advanced models. The target variable of the prediction will be whether the startup has been successfully acquired (_success = 1_) or closed (_success = 0_). Code is available in _final.R_

**Models:**

1. **Logistic Regression** -- Statistical model used to predict probability of binary outcome (success/failed). This will be the benchmark model to compare the accuracy of prediction with the other models

2. **Decision Trees** -- Machine learning model that uses tree like structure (i.e., branches to split data) to predict the outcome 

3. **Bagging** -- A more advanced model of decision tree by taking the average of the outcome of the collection of decision trees

4. **Random Forest** -- Works similarly with Bagging, but with a more advanced and random features introduce in building the predictions to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting
